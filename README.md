# hw-6-gifyapi
Hello this project is all about accessing the gify api. You input a search term turn it into a button and then that button gets appened onto the page. From there you click on the button you just made to access the gify api and gif related to the title shows up on the screen. You can search for 1, 3 or 5 gifs. You also get the rating and title. The gif its self starts as a still and becomes a animated gif once you click it. You can also favorite a gif as well as remove a favorite if you choose. I also added local storage of the gif search buttons so the user can keep adding to their wall later if they so choose. The one thing I couldnt do was find a good video api. I wanted to make this video game gif and data related were you make video game themed buttons and then could get gifs or use that same button to access info on said game. My issue was either the video game api's I could figure out how to get into massively lacked in data or I couldnt figure out how access the api at this time. That is main area I feel I need improvment on going into the future
